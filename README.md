# RackStep

RackStep is (yet another) micro ruby framework for web development. 

Main goals are:
- be dead simple.
- keep the source small.
- implement only the necessary; No overcomplication.

If you like ruby frameworks like Sinatra, you may like RackStep.

## Why yet another framework?

Two main reasons:
- I like the principle behind Sinatra, but I dislike the way it is implemented, so I decided to create an alternative to use it on my side projects.
- I wanted to learn more about how Rack works.
